# importance-of-phase-in-image

Simple test to see whether the amplitude or the phase that carries information of an image. 

Following a Fourier Transform, an image will be decomposed into its Amplitude and Phase components. If we have two images, by swapping the amplitude of one image into another whilst keeping the phase intact (and vice versa) we can see which component i.e. Amplitude or Phase that contains the image information. 

The test is based on a seminal work from A.V.Oppenheim \& J.S.Lim,"The Importance of Phase in Signals", Proceedings of IEEE, Vol.69, Iss.5, May 1981). A 'classic' paper - which according to Google Scholar its citation is >2,600 times! (data per January 2026)
